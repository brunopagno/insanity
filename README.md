# Insanity

Another nodejs application.

The goal of this repo is to function almost like a blueprint. Whenever I need to spin up a new nodejs server I shall just clone this thing and go from there.

### Usage

```sh
npx --package=https://github.com/brunopagno/insanity insanity <dirname>
```

### Roadmap

Do not expect anything. Maybe more instructions and improvements come in the future.
